Q.What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Q.How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
Ans: staging area is intermidiate area between working directory and the repository, 
if we change in 2 files then staging area is the place where we can keep our file for commits as we finish working on both the file then,
we can simply add these files by add command and check status of commit by git status command.


If you accidentally add a file to the staging area, you can remove it using git reset. 
For example, if you accidentally add lesson_2_reflections.txt, but don’t want it to be committed yet, run git reset lesson_2_reflections.txt and 
the file will be removed from the staging area, but it will still be in your working directory.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
